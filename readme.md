## Applications



## tech-stack

### Ryu:
- Component-based software-defined networking (SDN) framework written in Python.
- Provides a library for implementing SDN controllers using the OpenFlow protocol.
- `Ryu_controller.py` file utilizes Ryu to create a custom application implementing basic OpenFlow functionalities.

### Tornado:
- Python web framework and asynchronous networking library.
- Well-suited for building high-performance, non-blocking web servers and applications.
- `App1.py` file uses Tornado to create a simple web application responding with "Hello, world" to HTTP requests.

# Aimeos TYPO3 extension
### Mininet:
- Network emulator used for creating virtual networks for testing SDN applications.
- Allows creating realistic network topologies using lightweight virtualization techniques.
- `mininet_setup.py` file sets up a custom network topology using Mininet, creating switches, hosts, and establishing links between them.

### OpenFlow Protocol:
- Communication protocol enabling control of forwarding behavior of network devices (e.g., switches, routers) by external controllers.
- Utilized by Ryu and Mininet for communication between the controller and switches in the network.

:star: Star us on GitHub â€” it motivates us a lot!
### Python:
- Versatile programming language extensively used in the project.
- Utilized for implementing SDN applications, web servers, and network automation scripts.
- All provided files (`Ryu_controller.py`, `App1.py`, `Simple_switchex.py`, `mininet_setup.py`) are written in Python.
